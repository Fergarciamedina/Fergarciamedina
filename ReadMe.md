# üí´ About Me:
üî≠ As a Data Scientist and Developer, I'm currently working on building innovative solutions that leverage my expertise in machine learning, data analysis, computer vision, and big data. I'm developing a predictive modeling tool that uses natural language processing and deep learning techniques to generate insights from unstructured data like customer reviews and feedback.<br>üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on exciting projects related to Mathematical Modeling, Machine Learning Algorithms, and Optimization. I am always interested in working with others who share similar passions and ideas.<br>ü§ù I‚Äôm looking for help with improving my proficiency in French and German languages. If you are proficient in either of these languages, I would love to receive any tips or guidance you can offer!<br>üå± I‚Äôm currently learning more about Cloud Computing and Digital Image Analysis in cell biology to expand my technical skillset and knowledge.<br>üí¨ Ask me about anything related to my work in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, or Bioinformatics. I am always eager to discuss new ideas and learn from others.<br>‚ö° Fun fact: I am a high-performance athlete in Taekwondo and Swimming, and I have volunteered as a teacher for Engineers Without Borders. Additionally, I am a contest winner in the HACKATHON ED TECH 2017 competition and served as Vice President of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society at the University of Engineering and Technology.
